Event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact
that it's single-threaded (offloading operations yo kernel)
we run ou immediate tasks first and then we run the callbacks (offload time consuming operations)



# Streams:  streams are used to read or write sequentially (extends eventEmitter class)
